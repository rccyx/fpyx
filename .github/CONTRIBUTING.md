# Contributing

This is a maintainer-light project.

If you’re here to use it, great.
If you’re here to improve it, even better.

## How this project works

- Pull requests are the default.
- Issues exist to document bugs, gaps, or edge cases.

Do not wait for permission to fix something. Just fix it.

If you found a bug and you can fix it, open a pull request directly and explain the fix clearly.

If there is an existing issue, link it.
If there is no issue, the PR itself is sufficient.

Do not ask whether you should fix it. If you can do it, just do it.
